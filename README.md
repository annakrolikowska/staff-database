<img src='https://i.ibb.co/3R5jDp2/database.png'> 


This project aims to create a solution for managing personal data of employees in the Beauty and the Beast estate. The json file contains personal data of the staff working at the castle.


 ## :bulb: Project features:
- Displaying employee personal data in a table format.
- **Filtering** data based on each attribute.
- **Sorting** data based on a selected attribute.
- **Pagination** of results, displaying 5 records per page.
  
These functionalities were implemented using **Redux** for state management. Redux was utilized to manage the state of filtering, sorting, pagination, and employee data.
